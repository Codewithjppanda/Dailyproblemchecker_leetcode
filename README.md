# 📬 Daily LeetCode Problem Checker

A Python bot that checks if you’ve completed your **LeetCode Daily Challenge** and sends you an email notification as a reminder or congratulations—every day before midnight.

---

## ✅ Features

- ✔️ Authenticates with your LeetCode account using session and CSRF tokens.
- 📅 Checks if you’ve solved the current day's daily problem.
- 📧 Sends an email:
  - If solved: a congratulatory message.
  - If not solved: a gentle reminder with a link to the problem.
- 🕒 Designed to be scheduled via `cron` or Task Scheduler for automation.

---

## 🔧 Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Codewithjppanda/Dailyproblemchecker_leetcode.git
cd Dailyproblemchecker_leetcode
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Create a `.env` file

```
EMAIL_SENDER=your_gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password      # Use Gmail App Password (not your Gmail login)
EMAIL_RECEIVER=recipient_email@gmail.com
LEETCODE_SESSION=your_leetcode_session_cookie
CSRF_TOKEN=your_leetcode_csrf_token
```

> ⚠️ Make sure your Gmail has 2FA enabled and use an App Password from [https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)

---

## 🔐 Security

- Ensure `.env` is **not committed** to Git:
```bash
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```

- If you accidentally push `.env`, **immediately revoke** any exposed credentials.

---

## 📅 Automating the Script

You can schedule this script to run daily at 11:55 PM using:

- **Linux/macOS**: `cron`
- **Windows**: Task Scheduler

Example `cron` entry:
```bash
55 23 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/leetcode_bot.py
```
